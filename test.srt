1
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,120
There were two of them.

2
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:24,990
It must be them again.

3
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:32,090
Iron Fist Ketil

4
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:28,250
Their footprints do look similar.

5
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,710
Why'd this have to happen
while the master's gone?

6
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,050
What's the damage?

7
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,610
One bag of flour and some dried meat.

8
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,720
It's no use, boss.

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,580
They're all mixed up with
other footprints. I can't track them.

10
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,270
No matter.

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,060
They don't steal much,
but they've developed a taste for it.

12
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:56,030
Do they think we don't know, Snake?

13
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:02,830
Fine, then.
Sounds like they need to be punished.

14
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,940
What? That's incredible.

15
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,020
That means the old master likes you.

16
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,680
Does he?

17
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,240
Yes, he does.

18
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,380
Not only does he
lend you his tools and horse,

19
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,740
but he invited you to eat
at the same table with him.

20
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:01,610
He's just paying us back
for doing his chores.

21
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:05,560
We're slaves.

22
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,170
Normally, people don't pay us back.

23
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,240
Oh, right.

24
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:18,010
Now that you mention it,
I guess you're right.

25
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:20,010
That's right.

26
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,270
But why does he like us, then?

27
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:29,020
Huh? U-Uh...

28
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,630
I'm sorry.

29
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:33,780
Einar, you're a good person.

30
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,450
You just don't realize it yourself.

31
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,440
What? No, wait, but...

32
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,170
Einar, I'm heading out.

33
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,160
I'm not that special.

34
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,540
Huh? Oh, sure.

35
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:56,910
Is he trying to be considerate?

36
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,880
He's a good guy, too.
Doesn't talk much, though.

37
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,990
I know.

38
00:04:04,990 --> 00:04:06,680
Arnheid!

39
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,300
Oh, no. It's the mistress.

40
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,480
Sorry for keeping you tied up.

41
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:12,890
Not at all.

42
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:17,650
I look forward to every morning
now that I have someone to talk to.

43
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:20,870
See you later.

44
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:24,690
See you tomorrow morning.

45
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:30,910
Yahoo!

46
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,330
She called me a good person.

47
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,630
I'm a good person!

48
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,430
How dare you stay out there chatting
when breakfast isn't even ready yet.

49
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:49,700
I'm sorry, mistress.

50
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,600
We don't keep you around for fun, you know.

51
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,090
You have to earn your keep.

52
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:56,940
Yes, mistress.

53
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,820
The master will be returning
from the thing today.

54
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,820
He might be bringing guests back with him,
so prepare accordingly.

55
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:13,210
I suppose an enslaved man would be
a good match for an enslaved woman.

56
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,400
Hey, they're sprouting.

57
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,460
These are wheat seedlings, Thorfinn.

58
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:26,090
They look so... feeble.

59
00:05:26,870 --> 00:05:28,450
Do they always look like this?

60
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,890
Yup, they sure do.

61
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:37,850
How strange. So these become bread?

62
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:39,800
Surprised?

63
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,560
Yeah.

64
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,980
Impressive, isn't it?

65
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:46,290
Yeah, it's amazing.

66
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,700
We'll grow and sell, grow and sell,

67
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,370
and eventually buy ourselves back.

68
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,170
It might takes years, but someday...

69
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,800
All right. I'm feeling motivated.

70
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,600
This is our first step toward freedom.

71
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,170
Let's clear these woods,
so we can plant double next year.

72
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:13,480
Oh...

73
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:21,440
We can eventually buy our freedom by farming,

74
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:25,080
but I wonder if Arnheid has a similar deal.

75
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:31,430
I don't know. Why don't you ask her?

76
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:36,930
You think it'd be okay to ask that?

77
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:41,020
More importantly, what are we
doing with these today?

78
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:45,340
Oh, the wheat?
We won't have anything to do for a while.

79
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,880
I see. So we should keep clearing the woods.

80
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,720
So we'll pray.

81
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,470
What? Pray?

82
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,190
Almighty God!

83
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,020
Make our crops grow!

84
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:04,060
Make them ripen and grow!

85
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,650
Keep insects and mold away!

86
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,400
Send the rain our way!

87
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,520
Join me.

88
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,620
What?

89
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:19,370
Who am I supposed to p-pray to?

90
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,280
Anyone.

91
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:26,210
Yahweh, Freya...
Pray to everyone and everything.

92
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,730
Get down here.

93
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:37,620
If we want a successful harvest,
all we can do is pray to God.

94
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:39,160
We have nothing to offer.

95
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:41,980
But we'll pray extra hard to make up for it.

96
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,320
Make our crops grow!

97
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,460
Come on. Put your hands
together and pray with me.

98
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,890
What? O-Okay...

99
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,740
M-Make our crops grow...

100
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,240
I can't hear you!

101
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,370
Okay!

102
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,160
Make our crops grow!

103
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:59,440
Don't be so embarrassed.

104
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,120
Nothing's more embarrassing
than doing it half-assed.

105
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,700
O-Okay!

106
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,980
Ready, and...

107
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,880
Keep insects and mold away!

108
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,630
Send the rain our way!

109
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,030
Wow, the farm hasn't changed at all.

110
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,540
Are Mom and Olmar doing well, Dad?

111
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:35,900
Yeah. Olmar is so full of energy,
he's a pain in my ass.

112
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,030
He's anxious to head off to battle like you.

113
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:44,600
He hasn't changed since he was little either,

114
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,580
even though he's a coward.

115
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,210
Everyone has their strengths
and weaknesses, Thorgil.

116
00:08:50,210 --> 00:08:52,440
He's not fit for battle.

117
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:56,050
People should stay where they belong.

118
00:08:57,050 --> 00:08:59,680
I wouldn't be so sure.

119
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,730
Sometimes the battlefield changes a man,
like King Canute.

120
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:05,180
"King"?

121
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:08,280
Nobody calls him a prince anymore.

122
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:11,720
He changed quite a lot in this war.

123
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,470
He's a proper general now.

124
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:19,580
Why not send Olmar to the battlefield
and see how he fares?

125
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,000
You can't be serious.

126
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,050
He'd never survive with his skills.

127
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:31,580
Isn't that the master?

128
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:33,850
Perfect timing.

129
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:37,300
Isn't that...

130
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:41,180
It really is you, Thorgil.

131
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:43,640
When did you get back?

132
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,310
Five or six days ago.

133
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:50,230
I ran into Dad at the thing,
so I thought I'd stop by.

134
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:53,730
You're a tough one. You haven't died yet?

135
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:57,990
Thanks to the training
you put me through, Snake.

136
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:01,370
Snake, what have you got trailing behind you?

137
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:03,120
Oh, right.

138
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,530
Hey.

139
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,540
Come on, hurry up.

140
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,100
They're thieves.

141
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,600
I was going to hand them over to you.

142
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,840
Thieves?

143
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:20,020
We'd been experiencing a rash
of similar burglaries recently.

144
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:24,150
I've got a hunch they're behind all of them.

145
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,730
They may be kids, but theft is theft.

146
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,950
They need to be punished, master.

147
00:10:56,850 --> 00:10:59,430
Sture, my hands hurt.

148
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,970
What's going to happen to us?

149
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,450
Are we going to die?

150
00:11:11,030 --> 00:11:14,610
It's okay. It's all right.

151
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,370
I'm right here with you.

152
00:11:20,130 --> 00:11:22,110
In other words...

153
00:11:22,110 --> 00:11:24,660
people talk about military units,

154
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,740
but nobody really cares who their
allies or enemies are supposed to be.

155
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:33,380
Once the fighting starts, you and your
clansmen pick your targets and attack.

156
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:37,310
Everyone's desperate to prove they're
the greatest daredevil on the North Sea.

157
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:42,760
After the battle,
you enjoy plundering the spoils.

158
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,600
Guys kill each other all the time
over women they can sell.

159
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,030
Olmar.

160
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:49,980
Huh?

161
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:53,500
What do you say?
Do you want to go to England?

162
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,160
Uh, I...

163
00:11:55,730 --> 00:11:57,980
What? You don't want to?

164
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:01,280
Oh, o-o-of course I'll go to war!

165
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,350
I'd love a chance to prove myself!

166
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:06,490
That's my little brother!

167
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,790
Ow...

168
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,920
Maybe I'll give you a souvenir.

169
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,980
Bring me my necklace.

170
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,730
Yes, sir.

171
00:12:21,230 --> 00:12:24,310
What is this, jerky? Can I eat it?

172
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,560
Sure, but ears don't taste very good.

173
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,640
Huh?

174
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,890
They're the ears of Englishmen.

175
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,810
Ears?

176
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,180
Oh, uh...

177
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,420
You really are a scaredy-cat.

178
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,470
How are you going to fight like that?

179
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,430
We're sons of Iron Fist Ketil.

180
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,290
Iron...

181
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,130
Iron Fist?

182
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:03,060
You don't know?

183
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:05,630
Our dad was a legend when he was young.

184
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:13,390
As soon as the fighting started, his weapon
would shatter under his own strength,

185
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:17,520
so he'd fight the rest
of the battle bare-handed.

186
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:21,050
He accomplished more than
anyone fighting like that.

187
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,570
What? Our dad?

188
00:13:27,570 --> 00:13:32,220
When I talk to the veterans,
the name Iron Fist comes up a lot.

189
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:34,810
You should show more respect to Dad.

190
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:40,140
Thorgil, you must be tired from your journey.

191
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:42,550
Why don't you rest inside?

192
00:13:42,550 --> 00:13:45,300
I'm not that weak.

193
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,650
Thorgil.

194
00:13:52,090 --> 00:13:55,560
If the great Iron Fist Ketil commands it.

195
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:57,690
Master.

196
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:04,770
I'm sorry, but could you take care of
those two before you go off to rest?

197
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:17,270
First, why don't you tell me your names?

198
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:21,390
Come on, tell him your names.

199
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,620
Don't do that.

200
00:14:23,620 --> 00:14:26,120
They can't speak because they're frightened.

201
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:27,170
Sorry.

202
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:32,100
Tell me your names.

203
00:14:34,010 --> 00:14:39,230
I-I'm Sture. My younger sister's name is Thora.

204
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:43,620
I see, I see. Sture and Thora.

205
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,480
Do you have anyone who could
speak in your defense?

206
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,360
Besides them, their family consists of
their mother and a baby.

207
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:54,900
Their mother was sick in bed,
so I didn't bring her here.

208
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,030
Their father is missing.

209
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:01,000
What's your father's name? Is he well?

210
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,500
Answer him.

211
00:15:06,570 --> 00:15:08,810
My d-dad is Snorri.

212
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:17,320
Last fall, he went out to sell vegetables
and never came back.

213
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,230
Is your grandfather's name by any chance Bo?

214
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:26,110
Yes.

215
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:30,360
Their father is Snorri, son of Bo.

216
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:33,680
He owes money on the land
he rents from you.

217
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,480
Ah, that Snorri.

218
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,970
I knew I hadn't seen him recently.

219
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,820
He must be dead.

220
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,780
He hasn't come back in a year.

221
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,250
He's not coming back.

222
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:47,920
A thief probably killed—

223
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,720
You're wrong! Dad's just out on an errand!

224
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,900
Traditionally, families that have
lost their breadwinner

225
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,110
are hired by other families to do work.

226
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:11,940
These children may be healthy,
but they have a sick mother and a baby.

227
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,900
Nobody would take them in.

228
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,410
What's the matter, honey?

229
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:22,270
J-Just got a bit of dust in my eye.

230
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:30,260
So, what did these two steal?

231
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:36,820
Their crimes are numerous, but they
confessed to stealing one bag of flour.

232
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,310
My men and I can attest to that.

233
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,430
You didn't threaten them
into saying that, did you?

234
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:47,690
No, of course not.
Though I did convince them to talk.

235
00:16:50,810 --> 00:16:55,570
I'll wait until this bag is empty.

236
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:59,510
You'll get off easy as long as you're honest.

237
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:07,230
I told them your name's written
on the bottom of our bags.

238
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,500
That's practically threatening them!

239
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:17,220
What? That wouldn't have been enough to
make them confess if they weren't guilty.

240
00:17:17,850 --> 00:17:21,470
Then it's simple. One arm.

241
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,230
M-My sister's still little!
Please go easy on her!

242
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:34,940
Oh? Then you'll accept
your sister's punishment, too.

243
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:36,990
We'll cut off both your arms.

244
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,050
No... Sture...

245
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:49,960
Well... I know what I said, but I'd like
to ask you to go easy on them, too.

246
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:55,590
Then it's decided. Right, Dad?

247
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:00,570
He's horrifying.

248
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,570
I can hardly believe he's my son.

249
00:18:05,330 --> 00:18:09,100
Why did you have to steal from me?

250
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:14,580
I have no choice but to punish you.

251
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,200
I'm against it.

252
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,800
You'd be practically executing him.

253
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:24,540
It's too great a punishment for theft.

254
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,690
Pater...

255
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:30,380
May I offer my opinion, master?

256
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:36,380
Yes. Yes, speak, Pater.

257
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:41,400
As one who helps run this farm,

258
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,600
I don't think it's right to harshly
punish such a young boy.

259
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,020
Cutting off both his arms
would make him useless.

260
00:18:49,990 --> 00:18:52,520
Sture, how old are you?

261
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,020
Twelve.

262
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:59,510
Good. That's old enough
to start working with the adults.

263
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:05,920
You must be compensated for their theft,
and their father's debt must be repaid.

264
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,400
They can pay you back by working.

265
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:16,050
I recommend that you hire these children
and their mother to work on your farm.

266
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:23,300
They can grow crops on the
land you lent to their father.

267
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:26,520
I'll teach Sture what to do.

268
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,940
If he grows into a good worker,
you'll be fully compensated for this matter.

269
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,700
They won't need to steal anymore, either.

270
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,680
It solves the problem.

271
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,060
Yes, yes. I couldn't agree more.

272
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:44,070
I must be compensated
for the loss, yes. In that case—

273
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:50,080
For the aforementioned reasons, I believe a
beating would be an appropriate punishment.

274
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,470
What?

275
00:19:57,010 --> 00:19:59,230
Well, I understand your argument.

276
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:06,820
No. No, wait. They can pay back
what they stole by working for me.

277
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:09,930
Paying off their debt
can be their punishment.

278
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:16,290
They can't get off with
no punishment at all, master.

279
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:20,610
If you don't, people won't take us seriously.

280
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:29,890
And nobody likes a kid with sticky fingers.

281
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,540
Punishing them is for their own good.

282
00:20:39,950 --> 00:20:42,310
How many strokes will it be?

283
00:20:50,090 --> 00:20:55,050
Five... Ten. Ten strokes.

284
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:58,010
That's ten strokes each.

285
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:02,550
You're first, boy. Bite down hard.

286
00:21:04,270 --> 00:21:05,840
Sture...

287
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,240
Stay back!

288
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,280
Sture!

289
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:12,140
Twenty! Hit me 20 times!

290
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:15,370
Just please, please don't hit my sister!

291
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:21,500
Oh? Now this is interesting.
You've got some guts.

292
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,380
Dad, let me do it.

293
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,360
What? But you don't know how to hold back.

294
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,530
N-No...

295
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,660
Don't kill him.

296
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,510
Yeah, yeah.

297
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,980
Be gentle.

298
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,040
Yeah, yeah.

299
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:35,060
Don't hit his head or anything.

300
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,520
Okay, okay.

301
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,730
Gentle, right? Here we go, kid.

302
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,570
Sture!

303
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,800
One.

304
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:54,160
Sture!

305
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,200
W-Wait. Stop, Thorgil.

306
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:57,070
I'll do it. I'll do it myself.

307
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:26,970
Where's Dad?

308
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,500
He went to bed.

309
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:33,870
Good grief. Iron Fist Ketil
must be getting old.

310
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:41,310
All that Iron Fist stuff is a lie.

311
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:48,090
A Norse man can't be a coward
and make it in this world.

312
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:55,570
Everyone expects me to be brave.

313
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:08,850
Nobody suspects a "great man"
like me would lie about that.

314
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:20,450
I'm afraid of Thorgil, my own son.

315
00:23:22,070 --> 00:23:26,010
I'm afraid of war. I'm afraid of violence.

316
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:34,700
Being kind can't possibly be a bad thing.

317
00:23:35,790 --> 00:23:39,680
I know your pain.

318
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:45,450
You're the only one who'd say that to me.

319
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:51,690
You're the only one I can tell everything.

320
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:56,490
Stay with me.

321
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:05,370
Without you, my world is full of darkness.

322
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:55,030
An Empty Man

323
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,190
"An Empty Man."
